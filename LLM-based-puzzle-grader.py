), ("""Let's start by declaring all the constants required:
- integer constants for every person's age.
- integer constants for every person's length.

(set-logic QF_LIA)

; Age of each person
(declare-const Merlin_Age Int)
(declare-const Bubba_Age Int)
(declare-const Draco_Age Int)
(declare-const Barnabas_Age Int)

; Length of each person
(declare-const Merlin_Length Real)
(declare-const Bubba_Length Real)
(declare-const Draco_Length Real)
(declare-const Barnabas_Length Real)

We'll explicit the conditions in the logic puzzle. The ages are in the set {5, 10, 15, 20} and lengths are in the set {9.4, 10.2, 12.0, 14.0}. Let's add these constraints first:

(assert (and
(or (= Merlin_Age 5) (= Merlin_Age 10) (= Merlin_Age 15) (= Merlin_Age 20))
(or (= Bubba_Age 5) (= Bubba_Age 10) (= Bubba_Age 15) (= Bubba_Age 20))
(or (= Draco_Age 5) (= Draco_Age 10) (= Draco_Age 15) (= Draco_Age 20))
(or (= Barnabas_Age 5) (= Barnabas_Age 10) (= Barnabas_Age 15) (= Barnabas_Age 20))
))

(assert (and
(or (= Merlin_Length 9.4) (= Merlin_Length 10.2) (= Merlin_Length 12.0) (= Merlin_Length 14.0))
(or (= Bubba_Length 9.4) (= Bubba_Length 10.2) (= Bubba_Length 12.0) (= Bubba_Length 14.0))
(or (= Draco_Length 9.4) (= Draco_Length 10.2) (= Draco_Length 12.0) (= Draco_Length 14.0))
(or (= Barnabas_Length 9.4) (= Barnabas_Length 10.2) (= Barnabas_Length 12.0) (= Barnabas_Length 14.0))
))

Now let's add the constraints given in the puzzle:

; Merlin is somewhat older than Bubba.
(assert (> Merlin_Age Bubba_Age))

; Merlin is 10.2 feet long.
(assert (= Merlin_Length 10.2))

; Bubba is 10 years older than the gator that is 14.0 feet long.
(assert (or (and (= Draco_Length 14.0) (= Bubba_Age (+ Draco_Age 10)))
            (and (= Barnabas_Length 14.0) (= Bubba_Age (+ Barnabas_Age 10)))))

; Barnabas is 12.0 feet long.
(assert (= Barnabas_Length 12.0))

Now let's ensure that they all have distinct ages and lengths:

; Distinct ages
(assert (distinct Merlin_Age Bubba_Age Draco_Age Barnabas_Age))

; Distinct lengths
(assert (distinct Merlin_Length Bubba_Length Draco_Length Barnabas_Length))

We close with the check-sat and get-model commands:

4. Movie-Genre:superhero is somewhere to the right of Movie-Genre:epic
LLM: Let's start by understanding the clues:

1. Transport:airplane and Movie-Genre:superhero have different parity positions: This means that if one is in an odd-numbered position, the other is in an even-numbered position, or vice versa.

2. Transport:helicopter is not to the left of Movie-Genre:superhero: This means that the helicopter is either in the same position as the superhero movie or to the right of it.

3. Movie-Genre:epic is somewhere to the right of Movie-Genre:zombie: This means that the zombie movie is to the left of the epic movie.

4. Movie-Genre:superhero is somewhere to the right of Movie-Genre:epic: This means that the epic movie is to the left of the superhero movie.

From clues 3 and 4, we can deduce that the order of the movie genres is: zombie, epic, superhero.

Now, let's consider the transport. From clue 2, we know that the helicopter is not to the left of the superhero movie. Since the superhero movie is in the third position, the helicopter must also be in the third position.

From clue 1, we know that the airplane and the superhero movie have different parity positions. Since the superhero movie is in the third position (an odd number), the airplane must be in the second position (an even number).

This leaves the roller in the first position.

So, the final associations are:

1. Zombie - Roller
2. Epic - Airplane
3. Superhero - Helicopter
